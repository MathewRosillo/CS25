Define a struct named Item with two members: name (string) and id (int). 
Use new to dynamically allocate an array of items. 
Populate the array with sorted sample data (id, name- sort by name), min 100 records. 
Implement a binary search function to find an item by id. 
Ask the user for an ID to search for, and display the result. 
Free the memory using delete[].
